# school-bookmarklets
Collection of bookmarklets for school and for fun. I did not make these and they were collected from other sources.
I did make the collection myself, I just didn't make the javascript myself.

<u>How do I use this?</u>

<b>IMPORT - </b>

First download the html file in releases. Then on the top right of your screen you will see the 3 dots, click that and click on "Bookmarks." After this, click on the bookmark manager. Then when you are on that page, click the 3 dots on that page. Click import bookmarks. Double click the html file. Then you will have the bookmarklets in your bookmark bar. Click the bookmarks on a page to use them. 

<b>SINGULAR BOOKMARKLETS - </b>

First click on one of the folders (Bookmarklet Games, Bookmarklets, and Fun Bookmarklets). Then drag the name to your bookmarks bar. To use it click on the bookmark. The name explains what it does, but I will put more detailed descriptions below this.
