Collection of bookmarklets for school and for fun. I did not make these and they were collected from other sources.
I did make the collection myself, I just didn't make the javascript myself. 

Source for kahoot and blooket bookmarklets: https://rogue.best

<b>NOTE: These bookmarklets have cheats and other stuff, use it responsibly. It's not my problem if you get in trouble or anything happens (Should not happen if you use it responsibly).</b>

<b>Change Log (v1.2)
  
  -Deleted all old blooket cheats. They are outdated and will get you banned or will make your page stop working. Replaced it with https://rogue.best and it's bookmarklets. 
  
  -Added extension remover and adder.</b>
 
<u>How do I use this?</u>

<b>IMPORT - </b>

First download the html file in releases. Then on the top right of your screen you will see the 3 dots, click that and click on "Bookmarks." After this, click on the bookmark manager. Then when you are on that page, click the 3 dots on that page. Click import bookmarks. Double click the html file. Then you will have the bookmarklets in your bookmark bar. Click the bookmarks on a page to use them. 

<b>SINGULAR BOOKMARKLETS - </b>

First click on one of the folders (Bookmarklet Games, Bookmarklets, and Fun Bookmarklets). Then drag the name to your bookmarks bar. To use it click on the bookmark. The name explains what it does, but I will put more detailed descriptions below this.

<b>Most important things.</b>

About Blank: Type in your site.

Ext. Remover: Go to https://chrome.google.com/webstorex

Ext. Adder: 

-Find the extension you want

-Come up with a name.

-Find a Picture you want (Find any site icon and put /favicon.io at the end. Ex: https://www.google.com/favicon.ico

-Find the extension id for the one you want. (Go to any extension you want on webstore and it should be at the end, ex: adbacgifemdbhdkfppmeilbgppmhaobf).

Eaglercraft: This one isnt a bookmarklet, its just a bookmark. You go to the site, right click, save, and then you load the file. 

Embed: You have to actually edit the bookmark. Find the part that says "Put URL here" and change it to a url you want. Ex: https://google.com/ 

-THIS IS NOT A PROXY ITS JUST A EMBED FEATURE.

-Also use the close embed bookmarklet to close it. 

Edit+: Basically edits the page until you press the bookmarklet again. 

All the fun bookmarklets should be self explanatory based on their name. Same with the bookmarklet games.
